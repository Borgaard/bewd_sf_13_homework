BEWD_SF_13 Homework Repository
=============================

This is the repository where you'll submit your homework. Only use this repository for your homework and any files you are contributing in class.

How To Use This Repo
-----------------------

Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/my_projects``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```BEWD_SF_13_homework``` folder using your real name and github account name, like ```BEWD_SF_13_homework/KishaRichardson-kisha```. That will make it easier for us to remember who everyone's github name is. :)
4. For each homework make sure to put your files in a new `hw_x` directory in your named directory.   Example for homework #3: `BEWD_SF_13_homework/KishaRichardson-kisha/hw_3/`

Example of what your folders should look something like:

```
~/projects/BEWD_SF_13_homework/KishaRichardson-kisha/hw_1/assignment_topic.rb
```

Instructions
-------------
Submit homework by pushing to your bewd_sf_13_homework repo, then submit a pull request. 

If any files are in the pull request outside of your personal `BEWD_SF_13_homework/yourName-githubUsername` folder, we will send it back to you to fix it!

Weekly Homework
----------------

Homework is given each Monday, and is always due the next Monday. Feedback on each assignment submitted **_on time_** will be provided by Wednesday via comments on pull requests.
